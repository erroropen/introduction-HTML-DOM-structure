    <p class="example">A rose is either a woody perennial flowering plant of the genus Rosa (/ˈroʊzə/),[4] in the family
        Rosaceae
        (/roʊˈzeɪsiːˌiː/),[4] or the flower it bears. There are over three hundred species and tens of thousands of
        cultivars.[5] They form a group of plants that can be erect shrubs, climbing, or trailing, with stems that are
        often
        armed with sharp prickles.[6] Their flowers vary in size and shape and are usually large and showy, in colours
        ranging
        from white through yellows and reds. Most species are native to Asia, with smaller numbers native to Europe,
        North
        America, and Northwest Africa.[6] Species, cultivars and hybrids are all widely grown for their beauty and often
        are
        fragrant. Roses have acquired cultural significance in many societies. Rose plants range in size from compact,
        miniature
        roses to climbers that can reach seven meters in height.[6] Different species hybridize easily, and this has
        been used
        in the development of the wide range of garden roses</p>

    <p class="example2">The leaves are borne alternately on the stem. In most species, they are 5 to 15 centimetres (2.0
        to 5.9 in) long,
        pinnate, with (3–) 5–9 (−13) leaflets and basal stipules; the leaflets usually have a serrated margin, and often
        a few
        small prickles on the underside of the stem. Most roses are deciduous but a few (particularly from Southeast
        Asia) are
        evergreen or nearly so.

        The flowers of most species have five petals, with the exception of Rosa omeiensis and Rosa sericea, which
        usually have
        only four. Each petal is divided into two distinct lobes and is usually white or pink, though in a few species
        yellow or
        red. Beneath the petals are five sepals (or in the case of some Rosa omeiensis and Rosa sericea, four). These
        may be
        long enough to be visible when viewed from above and appear as green points alternating with the rounded petals.
        There
        are multiple superior ovaries that develop into achenes.[9] Roses are insect-pollinated in nature.

        The aggregate fruit of the rose is a berry-like structure called a rose hip. Many of the domestic cultivars do
        not
        produce hips, as the flowers are so tightly petalled that they do not provide access for pollination. The hips
        of most
        species are red, but a few (e.g. Rosa pimpinellifolia) have dark purple to black hips. Each hip comprises an
        outer
        fleshy layer, the hypanthium, which contains 5–160 "seeds" (technically dry single-seeded fruits called achenes)
        embedded in a matrix of fine, but stiff, hairs. Rose hips of some species, especially the dog rose (Rosa canina)
        and
        rugosa rose (R. rugosa), are very rich in vitamin C, among the richest sources of any plant. The hips are eaten
        by
        fruit-eating birds such as thrushes and waxwings, which then disperse the seeds in their droppings.

        The sharp growths along a rose stem, though commonly called "thorns", are technically prickles, outgrowths of
        the
        epidermis (the outer layer of tissue of the stem), unlike true thorns, which are modified stems. Rose prickles
        are
        typically sickle-shaped hooks, which aid the rose in hanging onto other vegetation when growing over it. Some
        species
        such as Rosa rugosa and [R. pimpinellifolia have densely packed straight prickles, probably an adaptation to
        reduce
        browsing by animals, but also possibly an adaptation to trap wind-blown sand and so reduce erosion and protect
        their
        roots (both of these species grow naturally on coastal sand dunes). Despite the presence of prickles, roses are
        frequently browsed by deer. A few species of roses have only vestigial prickles that have no points.

        Plant geneticist Zachary Lippman of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory found that prickles are controlled by the LOG
        gene.[10][11] Blocking the LOG gene in roses reduced the thorns (large prickles) into tiny buds.</p>
